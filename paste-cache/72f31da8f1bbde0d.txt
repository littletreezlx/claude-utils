 * out-of-date source repos which you can update with `pod repo update` or with `pod install --repo-update`.                                                    
 * changed the constraints of dependency `sqlite3` inside your development pod `sqlite3_flutter_libs`.                                                          
   You should run `pod update sqlite3` to apply changes you've made.
