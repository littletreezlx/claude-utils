[ErrorHandler] E 15:49:09 ErrorHandler 全局错误: Build scheduled during frame.
While the widget tree was being built, laid out, and painted, a new frame was scheduled to rebuild the widget tree.
This might be because setState() was called from a layout or paint callback. If a change is needed to the widget tree, it should be applied as the tree is being built. Scheduling a change for the subsequent frame instead results in an interface that lags behind by one frame. If this was done to make your build dependent on a size measured at layout time, consider using a LayoutBuilder, CustomSingleChildLayout, or CustomMultiChildLayout. If, on the other hand, the one frame delay is the desired effect, for example because this is an animation, consider scheduling the frame in a post-frame callback using SchedulerBinding.addPostFrameCallback or using an AnimationController to trigger the animation. | {traceId: null, category: unknown, severity: medium, context: 平台错误, metadata: null, timestamp: 2026-01-10T15:49:09.812345}
